This is my "learn how to Vulkan" repo, it's uninteresting to everyone including me.

If for some reason you are interested, here's a list of projects this uses:

* [SDS](https://github.com/antirez/sds)
* [log.c](https://github.com/rxi/log.c) (Slightly modified)
* [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
* [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)

**What does borked mean?**

According to [Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/borked),
**borked**: (_slang_) not working properly
